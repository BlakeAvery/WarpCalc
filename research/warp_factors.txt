Notes:
- Warp 1 is 1c. After that everything follows some weird ass scale. Warp 10 is infinite, so the program should always
return these values as some sort of constant when they are inputted. I'm not sure if we'll bother with values below warp
speed, personally I don't see the point BUT it also wouldn't be too hard. I think.

- Apparently there's some equation used by Wolfram Alpha to calculate warp factors that is accurate up to warp 9.
The formula is v = w^10/3 c, where v is velocity, w is warp factor, and c is the speed of light.

- I'm thinking we should keep each warp factor in the code as a constant, just for a quick reference.

warp_factors.txt
This file is essentially some cheap documentation on how I came up with the actual code for calculating the warp shit
In Professor Tom Calabrese's list of steps for programming, this would probably be steps 1-3.

Warp Scale as as listed by that fucker Okuda (Obtained from Star Trek Encyclopedia ISBN 9780671536091):
Warp 1 - 1c
Warp 2 - 10c
Warp 3 - 39c
Warp 4 - 102c
Warp 5 - 214c
Warp 6 - 392c
Warp 7 - 656c
Warp 8 - 1024c
Warp 9 - 1516c
Warp 9.2 - 1649c
Warp 9.6 - 1919c
Warp 9.9 - 3053c
Warp 9.99 - 7912c
Warp 9.9999 - 199516c
Warp 10 - âˆžc / Transwarp speed

Function listing:

Main - Takes input, redirects to other functions
WarpToC - Takes a warp factor as parameter, returns float representing factor of c
CToWarp - Takes factor of c as parameter, returns float representing warp factor.
