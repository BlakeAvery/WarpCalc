 * WarpCalc - A program to convert warp factors from Star Trek to factors of c, the speed of light.
 * Uses what I'm pretty sure is the Okuda scale, cause whatever scale they were using in TOS doesn't
 * really line up with the rest of the series.
 * Made at 3 AM so don't expect any of this code to be good
